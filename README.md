# Soroban-Automation

## Overview
**Soroban-Automation** is a comprehensive automation framework designed to simplify and streamline the lifecycle management of smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain using Ansible. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to Soroban and smart contracts, Soroban-Automation provides an intuitive and efficient platform to automate the setup, deployment, monitoring, management, security, and infrastructure of your smart contracts.

In addition to managing smart contracts, Soroban-Automation integrates security solutions like **FreeIPA** for user authentication and **pfSense** with **Suricata** and **Snort** for network security.

## Features
- **Automated Environment Setup**: Quickly configure your development environment for smart contract and security management.
- **Compile and Deploy**: Automatically compile and deploy smart contracts to the Stellar network.
- **Contract Monitoring**: Easily monitor smart contract performance and state.
- **Efficient Management**: Manage contract updates and configurations with minimal effort.
- **Data Analysis and Backup**: Analyze contract data and ensure reliable backups.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and testing.
- **User Authentication**: Leverage FreeIPA for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Network Security**: Implement network protection using pfSense, Suricata, and Snort.

## Usage

Soroban-Automation is organized into several key stages, each defined by a YAML file. Hereâ€™s how you can use each stage:

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
Sets up your development environment for Soroban smart contract automation.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 01_soroban_env_setup.yaml

2. **Compile and Deploy Contract**:
Automates the compilation and deployment of your Soroban smart contracts.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 02_soroban_compile_deploy_contract.yaml

3. **Monitoring Contract**:
Monitors the performance and state of your deployed Soroban contracts.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 03_soroban_contract_monitoring.yaml

4. **Managing Contract Update:**:
Facilitates easy updates and management of your Soroban smart contracts.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 04_soroban_contract_update_management.yaml

5. **Analyzing and Backup Contract**:
Analyzes Soroban contract data and creates backups for reliability.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 05_soroban_contract_data_backup.yaml

6. **CI/CD Integration**:
Integrates your Soroban smart contract lifecycle with CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and testing.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 06_soroban_contract_cicd.yaml

7. **FreeIPA Integration for User Authentication**:
Sets up FreeIPA for user authentication and authorizes specific services for Soroban.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 07_freeipa_integration.yaml

9. **pfSense with Suricata and Snort for Network Security**:
Configures pfSense firewall with Suricata and Snort for intrusion detection and network security in your infrastructure.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 08_pfsense_snort_suricata_security.yaml


## Configuration

To customize **Soroban-Automation** for your specific needs:

- **Edit YAML Files**: Each YAML file can be modified to suit your environment and contract requirements. Look for variables at the top of each file and adjust as needed.
- **Add New Stages**: You can add new Ansible playbooks to extend the functionality of **Soroban-Automation**.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to manage sensitive data like Stellar network credentials and pfSense configurations.
