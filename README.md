2. **Compile and Deploy Contract**:
Handles the automatic compilation and deployment of Soroban smart contracts to the Stellar network.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 02_soroban_compile_deploy_contract.yaml

3. **Monitor Smart Contracts**:
Continuously track the state and performance metrics of your deployed Soroban contracts.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 03_soroban_contract_monitoring.yaml

4. **Managing Contract Update:**:
Streamlines the process of updating and managing Soroban contracts with ease.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 04_soroban_contract_update_management.yaml

5. **Analyze and Backup Contract Data**:
Gathers detailed insights and ensures secure backup of Soroban contract data.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 05_soroban_contract_data_backup.yaml

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:
Seamlessly integrate your contract lifecycle with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and testing.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook 06_soroban_contract_cicd.yaml

7. **FreeIPA Authentication Integration**:
Configures FreeIPA for secure user authentication and authorizes specific services related to Soroban.
